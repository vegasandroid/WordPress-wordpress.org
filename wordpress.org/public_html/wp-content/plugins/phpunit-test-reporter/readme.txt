Captures and displays test results from the PHPUnit Test Runner

== Description ==

Captures and displays test results from the [PHPUnit Test Runner](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-runner).

For more details, [please read through the project overview](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/test-results-getting-started/).

== Contributing ==

Thereâ€™s a Docker environment with several tools built in for testing.
To configure it, run `make` and it will automatically run `docker-compose`.
After that, to view the test environment, visit http://localhost:8080.

Usage:
- `make` or `make start`:  Builds a Docker environment for testing.
- `make stop`: Stops Docker test environment.
- `make shell`: SSH to Docker test environment.
- `make test`: Runs `php-unit` and `phpcs` in Docker test environment.

There is also a [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) command for updating the `README.md` file for Github
after updating `readme.txt`.

Usage:
- `npm install`: Installs necessary dependencies.
- `grunt readme`: Generates `README.md` with
  `[grunt-wp-readme-to-markdown](https://github.com/stephenharris/wp-readme-to-markdown)`.
