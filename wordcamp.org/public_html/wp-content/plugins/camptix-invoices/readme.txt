Be warned that you can't edit or delete a published invoice, soâ€¦ save it as draft before every items/information are ok!

You can drop a copy of file `includes/views/invoice-template.php` into your theme folder and name it `invoice-template.php`.
Then modify the HTML layout and styles as you want.
